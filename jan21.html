Sanctify them
through thy truth:
thy word is truth.</code></pre> 

<div align="justify">

									<p>
Sanctification means to be set apart for the Lord. After salvation there is a conflict between the flesh and the spirit. The victory of
the spirit over the flesh, that is, a prevailing will to do only the will of
God in all areas of our lives, is the centre-point of sanctification. We are sanctified when Jesus Christ becomes our all-in-all and we no longer struggle with doing God’s express will in our lives. Jesus Christ is our Sanctifier because He supplies the enablement for us to be sanctified through the outpouring of His grace. To subdue the flesh is the greatest challenge to every believer’s spiritual progress and until the flesh is subdued, we cannot speak of being sanctified.
									</p>
									
									<p>
What are the proofs of true sanctification? A Christian who is truly sanctified lives with the consciousness that everything in his or her life is now about Christ and no longer about himself. Sanctification does not demean the Christian’s personality but beneath every expression of a Christian’s personality is the undertone of surrenderness to the Master. For example, whenever there is a choice to please self or the Master, the sanctified believer chooses the latter at whatever cost it may demand. That is why sanctified believers like Paul the apostle will suffer persecution and go through all manners of affliction in the pursuit of kingdom assignment and count it all joy to be so afflicted. When Paul said in Acts 20:24 that all those troubles did not move him, he was echoing the voice of a sanctified servant of the Most High.									
									</p>
									<p>
Sanctification produces humility in us. A sanctified believer boasts only in the Lord. He does not project self and does not seek to protect self. Jesus Christ is the Defender of the truly sanctified believer. In the home of a sanctified husband, it is not all about him, so his wife is not neglected. Therefore, if a common problem facing the family will be solved by the wife, so be it. Sanctified believers don’t struggle to justify their actions because they only take action with the pleasure of our Father in view. Sanctification makes you to be at peace with your Maker. Sanctification will ultimately rid you of worries and anxiety as it creates room for God to undertake for you. <b>When He becomes Your undertaker, He makes you an overtaker.</b> Rejoice in the Lord.
