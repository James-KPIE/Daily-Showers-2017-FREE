									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matt. 1:18-32 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Isaiah 7:14</strong> <br />                         
Therefore the Lord
himself shall give you a
sign; Behold, a virgin
shall conceive, and bear a
son, and shall call his
name Immanuel.</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">
									<p>
										In Isaiah 7:14 and 8:8, Emmanuel which is another name of our Lord Jesus is rendered as Immanuel. They all refer to our Saviour and Matthew tells us that the name means <blockquote>‘God with us.’</blockquote> Jesus left His throne in heaven and came to dwell among men on earth. He walked on the soil of Palestine and ate with men and stayed close to His people. He identified with His sheep as He ministered to His teeming followers. Immanuel has been explained to mean <b>In-man-el</b> meaning <b>In-man-Elohim that is God (Elohim) who came in the form of man.</b> Philippians 2:6-7 makes this very clear. It reads <blockquote>“Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:”</blockquote>

									</p>
									<p>
										Jesus Christ came in human form because of the nature of His assignment. He came to bear the punishment for sin of which every man has become guilty through Adam. The punishment for sin was to be borne by man. Angels were not qualified to do so because they were not created in bodily form as man was. Angels are ministering spirits. The perfect substitute for the guilty sinner would be a man without sin. Jesus Christ came as a man without the copulation between a man and a woman so He would not be tainted with the corrupt seed of the sinful nature which entered into man when Adam sinned. He came as the last Adam to undo what Adam did in the Garden of Eden. He brought salvation to the world by dying a substitutionary death for our sin. He finished that work on the cross of Calvary from where grace was dispersed. His blood flowed for the cleansing of the foulest offender who would acknowledge His perfect work for our redemption. He finished the work for our redemption on the cross and He declared it in John 19:30. He said <blockquote>“It is finished.”</blockquote> There is nothing more to add to what Jesus did for our salvation.  
									</p>
									<p>
										Emmanuel abides with us to the end of the age (Matthew 28:20 and Hebrew 13:5). He goes through our trials with us and feels pain when we are in pain. He never abandons His sheep. The sheep has no claws, no horns and cannot run. Therefore Emmanuel watches over the sheep for protection and defence. Rejoice in the Lord.
