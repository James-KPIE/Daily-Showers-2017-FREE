							<h1>BREAD OF LIFE</h1>

									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading:  John 6:47-58 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Jn. 6:57</strong> <br />                         
As the living Father 
hath sent me, and I 
live by the 
Father: so he 
that eateth me, even 
he shall live by me.</code></pre>

										Jesus Christ did not mince words in telling the world that He is the Bread of life. He referred to the manna which the Hebrews ate in the wilderness. It was good for them until they got to the boundary of the Promised Land (Exodus 16:35) However, that manna which fell from heaven was a nutritional meal. It gave the Israelites physical strength for their journey for forty years in the wilderness. The body and the blood of Jesus constitute a spiritual meal. We shall consider the power of one meal in February. For now, we need to understand the spiritual significance of the sermon of Jesus Christ on this “Living Bread” from heaven.

									</p>
									<p>
										Jesus Christ dwells in us as soon as we receive Him as Lord and Saviour. When we receive His word, we receive Him and He dwells in us. In John 4:34, He said “my food (meat in KJV) is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to accomplish His work.” When the will of God becomes our pleasure, we are filled with His joy because He abides with us. No one ate the physical body of Jesus or drank His blood. His emphasis is that we must make room for Him to indwell us by receiving Him through faith. However, through the supernatural impartation which we receive through the Holy Communion, His body and blood become a spiritual reality to us and in us as we eat the substance which we recognize for that purpose. We eat by faith and we drink by faith and we reckon by faith that His life is transmitted into us and it works! Halleluyah. The just shall live by his faith.  
									</p>
									<p>
										Jesus Christ is the Bread of life. The Living Bread gives us supernatural strength. This bread of life deposits the wisdom of God in us. People have received healing through the administration of the Holy Communion bread and wine which stand for His body and His blood. The observance of this ‘Passover meal’ which was an instruction in Exodus 12:14, 24-27 is always a reminder also of our “Passover” from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of His dear Son when we were saved (Col. 1:13).
									</p>
									<p>
										Receive Jesus today as the Bread of Life and you shall have eternal life.   Rejoice in the Lord.
