							<h1>VICTORIOUS SAVIOUR</h1>

							<!-- Text -->
								<section>
									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>						<h4 align="right">Tue. Jan. 24, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 1 Cor. 15:51-58 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M:V 1 Cor. 15:57</strong> <br />                         
But thanks be to God,
which giveth us the
victory through our
Lord Jesus Christ</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">

									<p>
The greatest victory a man can have is the victory over sin and Jesus Christ in the architect and provider of that victory. The reason why victory over sin is the greatest is that once you receive it by receiving Jesus Christ as your Saviour, the tide
turns in your favour and you can then coast home with victory over the devil who is the wicked captor, over sickness, sorrow, disappointments, losses, frustration and over stagnation and much more.
									
									</p>
									<p>
To have victory over sin is to have God on your side. Victory over sin provides us with restoration of the lost relationship with our Maker. For the purpose of emphasis, let us quickly look at the losses of a sinner. One, a sinner loses peace with God (Isaiah 48:22). Two, a sinner loses the presence of God. It is the manifest, special presence of God (as opposed to His general presence everywhere and for everyone) that enables the believer see the invisible and touch the intangible. That is the atmosphere for miracles and only the saved soul can enjoy it. In Psalm 16:11, the Bible says: <blockquote>“in His presence there is fullness of joy.”</blockquote> Three, the sinner loses the power of God. In 1 Samuel 4 and 2 kings 4 we see the problem of sinners who were disconnected from the socket of divine power; the sons of Eli bore the ark without God’s presence because of their sin while Gehazi held the rod of Elisha without power.									
									
									</p>
									<p>
Four, the sinner loses partnership with God. God cannot be with a sinner in the manner in which a saint will enjoy partnership with Him. Therefore, the sinner has no guarantee of divine backup in anything that he does. So, the sinner can live in total frustration all his life. Five, the sinner loses the ultimate position with God. The destiny of the saved person is a place with God in eternity; but the sinner goes to hell. The wise choice before all of us is to accept the provision Jesus Chris has made for our victory over sin and all those five glorious blessings can be ours. Yes, there is nothing more to do than just believe. Six, the sinner losses supernatural prosperity (Psalm 35:27). Seven, the sinner loses divine promotion (Psalm 45:7).									
									
									</p>
									<p>
Victory in life is a choice. Those who make the quality choice of accepting Jesus Christ as their Saviour will continually rejoice over the devil who had been a master tormentor over their lives, whereas, those who live in sin will remain as slaves and captives under Satan in eternity. Why don’t you accept Jesus Christ today?. Rejoice in the Lord.
