									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Sat. Jan. 7, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: John 15:14 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: James 2:23</strong> <br />                         
And the scripture
was fulfilled which
saith, Abraham
believed God, and it
was imputed unto
him for
righteousness:
and he was called the
Friend of God.</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">
									<p>
										It takes an unusual loving friend to lay his life down for another. That is the requirement of love. A truly loving friend can only be recognized by the extent to which he or she is ready to make sacrifices or deny personal comfort in order to protect or seek the interest of a friend. True friends don’t stay in friendship because of what they will gain but for what they can contribute. May you be such a friend and may the Lord surround you with such friends.

									</p>
									<p>
										Jesus Christ is our great friend. In our relationship with Him, He already invested His own life into the friendship even before we knew Him or chose Him as our friend. Romans 5:8 says <blockquote>“But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were sinners, Christ died for us.”</blockquote> Today, all that Jesus requires us to bring to the table of our friendship with Him is obedience. As long as you obey His word, nothing can separate you from His friendship. 
									</p>
									<p>
										It is your responsibility to continue to cultivate the friendship with Jesus once you are saved by His precious blood which He sacrificially shed for your sin to be forgiven. There are, at least, two ways by which you can continue to nurture the friendship. One way is through <b>fellowship.</b> Each time you come into a living church to worship, you have the opportunity to have an encounter with other heavenly beings including Jesus Christ according to Hebrews 12:22-24. We must stay in fellowship to get closer to Jesus. He wants us to experience Him everyday. He wants to talk with us, not only to talk to us. He wants us to be sincere with Him and ask Him questions. Remember, only those who ask questions are entitled to answers.
									</p>
									<p>
										Two, through faith. To remain a friend of Jesus, we must keep our faith in Him alive even when we face daring challenges. Daniel and the three Hebrew boys kept faith alive in Him in the most difficult hour of their journey with Him. They refused to deny Him. They risked their lives to please Jesus their Friend. Little wonder He showed up with the boys in the fiery furnace (Daniel 3:25). Is Jesus your Friend?. Rejoice in the Lord.
