									<h3 style=color:red>Daily Reading: Eccl. 8:1-4 </h3>
									<pre><code><b style=color:red>M:V Ps. 62:11</b> <br />                         
God hath spoken once;
twice have I heard this;
that power belongeth unto
God.</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">
									<p>
										All power belongs to God. Jesus Christ is omnipotent as a member of the triune Godhead. Two days ago we observed that they co-exist and are co-powerful. In Psalm 62:11, the
Bible says that all power belongs to God. Let us take that as referring to God the Father. Then in Matthew 28:18, Jesus Christ said: <blockquote>“all power has been given unto Me.”</blockquote> In Acts 1:8 Jesus Christ again introduced us to the power in the Holy Spirit when He said: <blockquote>“But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you.”</blockquote>. When He conducted an impartation service for His disciples in John 20:22, He breathed on them and said unto them: <blockquote>“Receive ye the Holy Ghost.”</blockquote> This was to empower them for their apostolic assignment. Nobody can do the work of the kingdom without the power of God. We are richly blessed in the sense that we can tap into power directly by connecting to any member of the Godhead, especially, when our spirit is connected to God’s Spirit as we become spirit through redemption (see John 3:6).

									</p>
									<p>
										Salvation brings us to the corridors of divine power. It links us to the unlimited power of God. In the realm of the spirit, we are beyond all limitations when we are in tune with the Spirit of God. That is the realm in which we tap into power to heal the sick, to deliver the oppressed, to break yokes and cast out demons. Unfortunately, many believers still go to mountains to seek for the power which resides in them through sonship. Yes, a time out with God, to mortify the flesh in a retreat, is a must for us. We need to constantly find a place where our souls can be revived and re-connect to God. The Bible says that God has given the power of sonship to as many as have received Him through faith (John 1:12). The problem is that although many people carry the power, yet, they have not unleashed that power, so it remains dormant in them.  
									</p>
									<p>
Whoever is born again has access to the unlimited power of God and can do the exploits of faith. We can do all things because Jesus Christ dwells in us in His omnipotent nature. As we remain connected to Him, we are empowered and emboldened to confront the opposition and to terminate the harassments of the wicked forces around us. If you believe, you can tap into God’s omnipotent power. Rejoice in the Lord.									</p>
