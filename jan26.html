							<h1>PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE</h1>

							<!-- Text -->
								<section>
									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Thu. Jan. 26, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Philippians 1:27-30 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M:V Col. 2:8</strong> <br />                         
Beware lest any man
spoil you through 
philosophy and vain
deceit, after the 
tradition of men, 
after the rudiments of 
the world, and not 
after Christ.</code></pre> 



<div align="justify">
									<p>
We shall spend one more day to dwell on the issue we discussed yesterday. When Jesus Christ dwells in a man by the Spirit of God, the person begins to run the affairs of his life by the wisdom of God. There are so many areas where philosophy and the word of God coincide. There are very positive and
helpful thoughts from philosophers over the ages and there are children of God who have developed philosophical principles by which they run their businesses and family lives. The emphasis is that the principles by which we live must be founded upon the word of God.
									</p>
									<p>
Many years ago, I sat in the courtroom with a senior colleague who was also much older than I was and we got talking when the Judge took a short break. In the course of our discussion, we spoke about marriage and he told me that it is un-African for a man’s wife to know the extent of his wealth or the amount of money he has per time. I objected. My reasoning was influenced by the scripture. If the husband and wife have become one, how can a person keep vital information away from himself. Financial control is what is needed in the home and not to keep vital truth away from one another. When your wife has no idea what amount of money that you have, you can waste such resources on indulgences that may ultimately spell your doom. He did not argue further after my reasoning. Fortunately, the word of God cuts across every culture and every tribe. That is why it is wisdom to draw our philosophy to work with from the word of God.									
									
									</p>
									<p>
Every person needs principles to work with from the word of God. Tithing is a principle. Honouring your wife is a principle. To shout your wife down in the public is not only uncivilized, it does not conform to God’s word. You need a principle on that too. To be arrogant to your husband for any reason is unacceptable in the light of the word of God. You need to develop a principle of restraint when provocation comes and you need philosophical equanimity when disappointments and betrayals come. You need to develop a principle of letting God have His way as Job did. Otherwise, you may die before your time if you cannot manage crisis or tragedy. An enduring life must be based on the principle from the word of God. Rejoice in the Lord.
