							<h1>DELIVERER</h1>

									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Gal. 1:3-4 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: 2 Cor. 1:10</strong> <br />                         
Who delivered us
from so great a
death, and doth
deliver: in whom we
trust that he will yet
deliver us;</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">
									<p>
										Jesus is the great deliverer. He delivers from sin and from the wicked works of the adversary. David understood the power of God to deliver. In Psalm 18:17, he said <blockquote>“He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong from me.”</blockquote> Jesus Christ delivers His people in an amazing fashion. He delivered Paul from all those who wanted to abort his vision for the kingdom of God. Time and again Paul witnessed the hand of Jesus in deliverance and being emboldened by the consistency of God’s deliverance, he declared in 2 Timothy 4:18: <blockquote>“And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.”</blockquote> Daniel bore testimony of the Lord’s deliverance. In Daniel 6:27 he declared concerning the Lord’s deliverance: <blockquote>“He delivereth and rescueth, and He worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.”</blockquote>

									</p>
									<p>
										God is fearful in deliverance. That is one of the reasons why we should do everything to abide in Jesus. He often operates the law of substitution as a strategy in deliverance operations. For example, He delivered the Israelites from the Red Sea but Pharaoh and his host perished therein instead. Haman perished in the gallows he prepared for Mordecai. The flame of fire slew those who bound the three Hebrews in their attempt to drop them in the fiery furnace. The lions ‘sowed’ Daniel as a ‘seed’ so they got his enemies as a harvest for their food the following day. The Assyrian soldiers perished in the place of the people of Judah. Herod and company became a sacrifice for the life of Baby Jesus. The list is endless. 
									</p>
									<p>
										There is no oppression too tough from which Jesus cannot deliver. That is why He came. If He delivers us from the power of sin there is no other ill from which He will not deliver us. I have defined deliverance as <b>the rescue of the least powerful from the more powerful by the most powerful.</b> Are you a child of God who is being molested? Report your oppressors to Jesus as you abide in His righteousness and watch Him deliver you in grand style. He is our great Deliverer. Rejoice in the Lord.
