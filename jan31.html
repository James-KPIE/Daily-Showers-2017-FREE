									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M:V Psalm 24:1</strong> <br />                         

The earth is the LORD'S,
and the fulness thereof;
the world, and they that
dwell therein.</code></pre>

									<p>
In furtherance to our thought from yesterday’s sermon, we want to spend more time to explore the ownership which God exerts over all He has created. Psalm 104:24 opens our eyes to the place of God’s wisdom in the creation of all that we
see. We read “O Lord, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom
hast Thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.” Jesus Christ is the Landlord of the universe. He is the Lord over all we can see in creation and the things we cannot even see. This truth is capable of helping us in holding to the Lord by faith in the hour of our need. If your father owns everything and there is no want in Him and He satisfies the desires of all, then it is wise and beneficial to depend on Him at all times.
									
									</p>
									<p>
The Lord is the Owner who gives to whomever He pleases according to Daniel 4:17, 25. King Nebuchadnezzar learnt that lesson in a hard way during his seven years in the University of humiliation. He arrogated his success to his personal effort and declared that his own very hands had built his sprawling palace. He did not acknowledge the Lord who is the Giver of all resources and the wisdom to maximize them for human comfort. The young king Uzziah who started to reign as a teenager also lost it all to pride when his heart was lifted up at the peak of his success and fame of his dynasty. When Herod gave an oration and it was ascribed to his ‘deity’, God sent worms to eat him up. God owns us and all our achievements because we can have or do nothing except through divine enablement. The most astounding of all technological breakthroughs is traceable to the Lord who gave the human brain to man. No human being has tapped into ten percent of the ‘installed’ capacity of the human brain. I read that if anyone goes that far, he’ll become mad. Man owes all to the Lord of all.									
									
									</p>
									<p>
Fortunately, for the man who can acknowledge Jehovah as the Lord of all and over all, he will continue to draw inspiration and resources from the inexhaustible reservoir of God’s wisdom and resources. We shall deal more on that tomorrow. Let this God be your all. Don’t strive with your Maker (Isaiah 45:9). <b>The Bread of Life is the Bread Winner for all.</b> Rejoice in the Lord.
