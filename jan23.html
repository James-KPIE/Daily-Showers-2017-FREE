									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Hebrews 13:8 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M:V Deut. 32:40</strong> <br />                         
For I lift up my hand to
heaven, and say, I live
for ever.</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">
									<p>
Jesus Christ is the Unchangeable Changer. That is why the Bible calls Him the Ancient of days. He never grows old. Nothing can be done to infract or diminish His personality. In Malachi 3:6
the Lord says: <blockquote>“I change not.”</blockquote> The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit share the same divine nature. God won’t change in nature, in attitude, in His judgment. His word cannot be modernized. Everything may change but His standard remains the same. What He called sin two thousand years ago remains sin today. What God calls adultery is what people refer to as just going out with another person of the opposite sex to whom they are not married. That does not change what God calls it. He says it is sin and it remains sin. We may call bribery an act of human relations. That is our own definition. God regards it as corruption and it is sin. No matter the permissiveness we find in the world today, God’s views remain the same. He changeth not.
									</p>
									<p>
God cannot be modernized or upgraded. Any civilization that attempts to alter His clear and unambiguous word will drive people into hell. What I see all around today is evils on increasing scales because of the ungodly permissiveness of this age. In many nations, human rights are elevated above the laws of God. Who does not know that the devil has turned the world upside down when a man now marries another man and a woman, another woman. Whereas the word of God says <blockquote>“a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall become one flesh.”</blockquote> In case anyone does not know that wife refers to a woman, Genesis 2:22 makes it clear. In Genesis 2:25 the man was Adam and his wife (a woman) was Eve. It takes a degree of hardening of the heart to call what God has clearly defined as another thing. For further clarity, Romans 1:27-32 provide us with more help.									
									
									</p>
									<p>
God does not adjust to the foolishness of man. We all need to adjust to His inerrant word. God’s solution to the problem of sin is Jesus Christ whom He sent to die for our sin. If a person chooses to continue in sin rather than accept the provision of atonement in Christ Jesus, then he will face the ultimate judgment. The choice is yours. Rejoice in the Lord.
