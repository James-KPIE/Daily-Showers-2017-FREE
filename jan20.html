							<h1>ROCK OF AGES</h1>

									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Fri. Jan. 20, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style=color:red>Daily Reading: Deut. 32:1-4 </h3>
									<pre><code> <b style=color:red>M:V Deut. 32:18</b> <br />                         
Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.</code></pre> 
<div align="justify">
									<p>
Jesus Christ is the rock of ages. The word rock is used to describe something that has existed from the ancient times. Rock is also figuratively used to refer to a refuge. It also depicts strength. In Romans 9:33, Paul referred to the quotation fromIsaiah 8:14 when he wrote: <blockquote>“As it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of offence: and whoever believeth on Him shall not be ashamed.”</blockquote>
									</p>
									<p>
There is no foundation as strong as the foundation in Christ. Whoever stands on this rock cannot sink. The rock also provides protection. If we dwell in Christ, then, we have made the Rock of ages our fortress. Little wonder God said in Isaiah 49:16: <blockquote>“Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of My hands; thy walls are continually before Me.”</blockquote> The word ‘graven’ has to do with engravement. Our destiny is engravened in the Rock of ages. In Isaiah 51:1-2, we find another reference to the Rock of ages. God desires to boost our faith in Him, so, He refers us to Abraham’s calling, blessing and lifting all of which are the doings of the Almighty God. In this verse of scripture, God encourages us to tap into the blessings of Abraham by focusing on Him. He says “Look unto the Rock whence you are hewn.” We were brought forth from a strong place. That is why we are created to be mighty on the earth, according to Psalm 112:2.																		</p>
									<p>
Rock of ages refers to God who has been the Strength and Defender of His people since the beginning of creation. He made us <b>mighty</b> in nature. In Genesis 23:6, Abraham was referred to as a <b>mighty</b> prince. In Genesis 26:16, Isaac was described as <b>mightier</b> than the Philistines by the king of Gerar. In Exodus 1:9, Pharaoh complained that the Israelites in Egypt were <b>mightier</b> than the Egyptians. By the divine nature of God in us, we are empowered with the spirit of might. Isaiah 11:2 confirms this. From age to age God has not diminished in strength. God would want all His children to reckon Him faithful to bless, to defend and to cause them to prevail because He is our backbone. Jesus Christ is the Rock that never fails. We can trust God to be our Strong Ally as we remain faithful to Him. Rejoice in the Lord.																		</p>
