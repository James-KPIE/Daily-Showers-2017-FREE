									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M:V Matt. 1:21</strong> <br />                         

And she shall bring
forth a son, and
thou shalt call his
name JESUS: for he
shall save his people
from their sins.</code></pre> 

<div align="justify">

									<p>
The name “Jesus” is derived from the Hebrew word Yehoshua which means Joshua by transliteration and or Jehoshua means <blockquote>“Jehovah is salvation.”</blockquote> That is the exact meaning of the name Jesus according to Matt. 1:21. Joshua was
a captain of the army of Israel and God used him in marathon war campaigns to possess the Promised Land. You will recall that both Joshua and his predecessor Moses were involved in the deliverance of Israel from the Egyptian slavery and bondage. The people of Israel were under a terrible yoke of oppression in Egypt and life was made unbearable for them by the task masters and slave drivers who were appointed by Pharaoh to make life difficult and unbearable for them. Joshua was involved in bringing liberation to the enslaved Hebrews. Hence his name was called Yeshua because he was a ‘saviour’ in bringing freedom to the people and setting them free from the yoke of slavery.
									</p>
									<p>
Jesus Christ came to liberate man from the oppression and tyranny of sin which placed man at the mercy of the devil. The devil is a master over every sinner. He can manipulate his life and bring him into subjection at will. The devil is merciless and only Jesus can set a man free from him. That is why Jesus Christ our Yeshua came to the world to save the world from sin. We need to constantly address the issue of sin because until a man is set free from sin by the blood of Jesus, he remains a captive in the hand of the devil. Since the devil was cursed by God in Genesis chapter 3 to feed on dust and the man, without God’s Spirit, is dust, the devil is permitted to feast on such people’s health and wealth, favour and well-being.									
									
									</p>
									<p>
The adversary is a tormentor and a killer, thief and destroyer. The so-called ‘pleasures’ of sin are the chains through with the devil binds his victims so as to keep them in captivity. The good thing is that Yeshua never turns back anyone that comes unto Him with a genuine heart of repentance. Run to Yeshua today for your salvation and you will not regret the choice. Rejoice in the Lord.
