									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Tue. Jan. 10, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matthew 19:27-28 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: 1 Cor. 6:2</strong> <br />                         
Do ye not know that the
saints shall judge the
world? and if the world
shall be judged by you, are
ye unworthy to judge the
smallest matters?</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">
									<p>
										Jesus Christ is the ultimate Judge and His judgment is righteous judgment. Those who are redeemed by His blood have escaped judgment but they shall sit with Him in judgment over those who did not believe in Him. I
want to consider two aspects of judgment as a subject today. The first part is the danger of waiting for Jesus as a Judge rather than embracing Him now as a Lamb. The Lamb is gentle. Jesus Christ is gentle and loving, caring and compassionate. That is why He calls all sinners to come unto Him so that He would take care of their sins and their names will no longer be on the court list in heaven, but in the book of life.

									</p>
									<p>
										Those who have believed in Jesus Christ and are saved shall no longer be judged. When Apostle Paul spoke about the coming of the Holy Spirit as coming to convict the world of sin and judgment, he was not speaking of believers in Christ. Any believer who is washed by the blood of Jesus Christ and abides in Him has escaped judgment. The conviction for sin had come at the time we repented of sin with the sorrow that accompanied repentance. If you are abiding in Christ, you no longer have any judgment to fear. What a privilege that we shall sit with Jesus when he will judge this world. Redemption has changed everything in our favour.  
									</p>
									<p>
										The second issue, in relation to the subject, is the case of those who have suffered injustice and it appears they will not have any remedy. The righteous Judge is waiting to sit upon such cases. When Abel died due to the unprovoked anger of his brother Cain, his blood cried for justice. When Joseph was sent to prison for an offence he did not commit, the great Judge was watching. When the three Hebrew boys were being bound and thrown into the fiery furnace, the Judge was looking. When John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ was beheaded by Herod, the ultimate Judge did not say a word. He never forgets. He remembers. In many cases, the Judge redressed some of those injustices and used some cases to bring about the lifting of His innocent children. If your own case has not been redressed, wait for the righteous Judge. He will surely Judge. Rejoice in the Lord.
