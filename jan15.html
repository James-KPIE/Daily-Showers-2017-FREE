							<h1>NAZARENE</h1>

									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Sun. Jan. 15, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matthew 2:19-23 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M:V Matt. 2:23</strong> <br />                         
And he came and dwelt
in a city called
Nazareth: that it might
be fulfilled which
was spoken by the
prophets, He shall be
called a Nazarene.</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">
									<p>
										A Nazarene is an inhabitant of Nazareth. The word also refers to a Nazarite which means “One separated.” You will recall that in Judges 13:5, the angel told the mother of Samson that he shall be born a Nazarite whose head shall not be touched with razor. Samson was born as one separated to begin
to deliver Israel from the Philistines. Until he became careless through avoidable indulgence, Samson was very powerful as the power of the Almighty God rested mightily upon him. Although John the Baptist was not specifically name a Nazarite or Nazarene, he was also another ‘one separated’ for a special assignment to be the forerunner of Christ. The same condition of abstinence from wine or strong drink was given for both Samson and John the Baptist (see Judges 13:14 and Luke 1:15).

									</p>
									<p>
										There is no doubt that our Lord Jesus Christ’s assignment was greater than those of Samson and John the Baptist. Jesus Christ came to save the world from sin. As a Nazirite in the order of Samson and John our Lord Jesus lived pure and holy and no sin was found in Him. Psalm 45:7 and Hebrews 1:9 attest to His righteousness. Both scriptures say “Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.” Our Lord Jesus maintained total consecration unto His Father and remained committed to the fulfillment of His earthly assignment. 
									</p>
									<p>
										We must remember that our Lord Jesus Christ left us a great lesson from His great achievements inspite of His lowly background. You will recall that Nathaniel asked Philip whether any good thing could come out of Nazareth (John 1:46). That was an indication of the low rating of the nativity of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ did exploits, the low expectations about Nazareth notwithstanding. As someone has rightly said: “your background does not need to put your back on the ground.” What you make of life is what counts, not the story behind your emergence. Your world will celebrate you if you can push beyond barriers and make impact. Rejoice in the Lord.
