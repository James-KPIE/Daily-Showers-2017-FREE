							<h1>WISDOM OF GOD</h1>

							<!-- Text -->
								<section>
									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Wed. Jan. 25, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: 1 Cor. 1:20-25 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M:V 1 Cor. 1:24</strong> <br />                         
But unto them which 
are called, both Jews 
and Greeks, Christ 
the power of God, and 
the wisdom of God.</code></pre> 



<div align="justify">
									<p>
Jesus Christ is the wisdom of God. Our Lord came to this earth with the wisdom that is superior to any kind of human wisdom. The Greeks are known for high sounding and deep philosophy. The danger with human philosophy generally is that
it has persuasive effect on the intellect of man and may
influence human judgment. However, it lacks the capability to address the issues of the soul where man must be spiritually influenced. There is no human philosophy that can handle the issue of the salvation of man. Therefore, <b>a philosophical icon may be witty in knowledge, highly scientifically discerning, able to capture relational matters of human behavior, very ascetic through self-mortification, yet, remains a sinner.</b>
									</p>
									<p>
<b>A man is not a sinner because he sins; rather a man commits sin because he is a sinner.</b> This requires a little more explanation. As soon as you are born again, you become righteous through the righteousness of Jesus which is imputed to you. By spiritual nature you are no longer a sinner. That does not mean you can never commit a sin. There is a provision for you in your new spiritual positioning for any sin which may occur, perhaps, unintentionally. That is found in 1 John 1:7-9. That provision is not for a sinner who has not repented. An unrepented sinner does not have Jesus Christ as his or her Advocate. <b>Jesus Christ must become your Saviour first before He can become your Advocate.</b> The redeemed soul is no longer dwelling in the state of sin but in the state of the righteousness of God because of the translation or conveyance that has taken place in respect in his life according to Colossians 1:13. The new believer must abide in Christ through holiness which is founded in obedience as he draws grace from Christ to remain continually sanctified.									
									
									</p>
									<p>
The things of God are foolish to man, even to the great philosophers of the ages. Human philosophy may sound very logical. Beware of such if it does not have its root in the word of God. The test to pass is whether or not it is according to the word of God. Every philosophy which does not pass this test is fake. Avoid it. Rejoice in the Lord.
