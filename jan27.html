							<h1>EXCELLENT JESUS</h1>

									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Fri. Jan. 27, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Deut. 32:1-4 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Mark 7:37</strong> <br />                         
And were beyond
measure astonished,
saying, He hath done all
things well: he maketh
both the deaf to hear,
and the dumb to
speak.</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">
									<p>
Jesus Christ is the greatest in excellence. His works display excellence. He is perfect in excellence and whatever He does needs no improvement. In Genesis 1:31 the scripture says that God saw everything He had made, and behold, it was very good. One of the reasons why every person on this planet earth needs Jesus is that He is the only One who runs our lives without
any error. He is the perfect surgeon when our cases require surgical operation. In Genesis 2:21-22 God carried out a perfect surgery on Adam to bring forth Eve and there was no drop of blood. When the children of Israel were in the desert on their journey to the Promised Land, He fed them with manna from heaven. It was a meal cooked in heaven, ready for consumption (Exodus 16:35).
									</p>
									<p>
It is only the manufacturer that can understand how best a product can function. God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit spoke forth concerning the creation of man in Genesis 1:26. It was a perfect man that was created from the counsel of the triune God. When sin tainted the nature of the man who was made in God’s image, he lost the glory of the divine nature through the depravity of sin. After the fall, Adam’s offspring was no longer a bearer of God’s image; rather, the son bore the likeness (corrupted nature) of Adam. The work which Jesus Christ, the Most Excellent, came to do was to restore the original nature (divine) in us so we can show forth the Excellency of Jesus once again. When a man experiences that transformation into the original image of God, then he can exclaim as the psalmist did in Psalm 139:14(c): “I praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.” When such a man looks around him, be begins to see the wonderful works of the Most Excellent One (v.14b).									
									
									</p>
									<p>
What do you see all around you? A man can only see according to the colouration of the lens of his eyes. To see the Lord’s good works and have an experiential taste of same, come to the Most Excellent One and receive the touch of His excellency. Rejoice in the Lord.
