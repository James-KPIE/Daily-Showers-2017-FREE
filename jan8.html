							<h1>GOOD SHEPHERD</h1>

									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Psalm 23 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: John 10:14</strong> <br />                         
I am the good shepherd,
and know my sheep, and
am known of mine.</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">
									<p>
										It is always good to pay attention when Jesus Christ declares who He is to us. The purpose is not only to create an
awareness in us but also to empower and embolden us. Our
confidence can only be reinforced when we know what Jesus Christ has done on our behalf and how He stands with us in the journey of redemption. That is why Daniel 11:32 tells us that those who know their God shall be strong and do exploits. David demonstrated that confidence when he declared, by experiential knowledge, that <blockquote>“the Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want” (Psalm 23:1).</blockquote>

									</p>
									<p>
										A shepherd’s foremost responsibility to his sheep is provision. He <b>feeds</b> them by looking for food for them. Jesus Christ saw to it that He did not only feed the teeming crowd at His crusade with the word of life, He also fed them with physical food. Secondly, the shepherd <b>fends</b> off predators from the sheep in order to preserve their lives. The sheep don’t have claws with which to fight; neither do they have horns to do battle nor speed in case the need to run arises. These are some of the reasons why the shepherd goes the extra mile to protect the sheep. The shepherd also directs the movement of the sheep so as to keep them within the sphere of safety. The shepherd accepts absolute responsibility for the survival and preservation of the sheep. That is what Jesus Christ does for us. Isaiah 49:16 confirms this when it says that we are ingrained in the palms of the Almighty.  
									</p>
									<p>
										The sheep has a corresponding responsibility to discharge even as the shepherd is committed to keeping the sheep. The sheep must submit to the shepherd. Deuteronomy 32:10-14 shows God as the shepherd when Jacob returned as a sheep to God. One, the Lord took delight in Jacob and found him (v-10) when he sought the Lord. Two, he enjoyed divine guidance (v.10) because he was submissive to the shepherd. Three, Jacob enjoyed divine protection (v.10) because he now trusted in God rather than in his own arm of flesh. Four, he enjoyed divine direction (v.12) because he became meek (see Ps. 25:9). Five, he was lifted up (v.13) because he relied on the shepherd. Six, he was provided for (v.13) because he obeyed the shepherd. Seven, he obtained wisdom (eating of honey v.13) because he learnt from the shepherd. Let us imitate Jacob. Rejoice in the Lord.
