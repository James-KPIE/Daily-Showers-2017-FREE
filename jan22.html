							<h1>TRUE VINE</h1>

									<h3>Daily Reading: John 15:1-7 </h3>
									<pre><strong style="color:red"><code>M:V. John 15:1</strong> <br />                         
I am the true vine, 
and my Father is the 
husbandman.</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">

									<p>
The vine is a fruit bearing plant. It produces a very sweet and nutritious fruit called grape which comes in different colours. The plant has a stem with clustered branches. The branches are
usually pruned to give room for more growth and fruitfulness.
Naturally, each branch receives nourishment through the Stem which also draws nutrition from the soil through the roots. The branches, therefore, depend on the stem of the vine for life and if a branch is severed for a few minutes, the leaves on it will turn pale and wither later because it has been cut off from the main stream of the supply of nutrient.
									</p>
									<p>
Jesus Christ is the Vine and we are the branches. He has called us to glory and He is the Root and Carrier of that glory. It is that glory that causes us to shine. Our spiritual life and growth depend on Jesus Christ and we cannot afford to get severed from Him. If we do, we die spiritually and other kinds of death may follow. A Christian who disconnects from Jesus will suffer the cessation (death) of inspiration, revelation and sanctification. It is the presence of the life of Jesus in us that brings spiritual value to our lives. If we lose touch with Jesus Christ the Vine, we become ordinary and are vulnerable to all manners of attack from the adversary. No believer can afford to get estranged from Jesus Christ because we draw our lives from His life. John 1:4 says <blockqoute>“In Him was life (He was the origin of life) and the life was the light of men.”</blockqoute> We shine as long as we have life from the light which He supplies. That light causes us to overcome darkness (John 1:5). Acts 17:28 says: <blockqoute>“In Him we live, in Him we move and in Him we have our being.”</blockqoute> Outside Christ, we are worth nothing.									
									</p>
									<p>
How do we receive nutrition from Christ? Basically through His word. The word feeds us (Jeremiah 15:16 and Ezekiel 3:3); sanctifies us (John 17:17); cleanses by washing us (Ephesians 5:26) and Guides by lighting our path (Psalm 119:105). Obedience to His word is the key to our being sustained by Him. As we abide in Jesus Christ the Vine all shall be well with us and we shall be fruitful all-round. Rejoice in the Lord.
