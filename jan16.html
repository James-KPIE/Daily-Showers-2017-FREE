									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Isaiah 60:1-2 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M:V Isa. 66:1</strong><br />                         
Thus saith the
LORD, The heaven
is my throne, and
the earth is my
footstool: where is
the house that ye
build unto me? and
where is the place of
my rest?</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">
									<p>
										Jesus Christ is Omnipresent. The triune Godhead are co-present, co-existing and co-powerful. We shall consider the aspect of the omnipresent nature of Jesus today. Our Lord Jesus Christ does miracles, signs and wonders simultaneously all over the world today and His name works everywhere, to save and to
deliver. While He was on the earth in human form, He was
limited, physically, to the place where He was at a given time although His power was not so limited. You will recall that He sent His disciples with His word to go and take the colt, upon which He rode to Jerusalem, from where the colt was tied. He did not go with them but the power of His spoken word did. Upon resurrection, our Lord Jesus was glorified. The limitations of the physical body left Him. In Luke 24:13-31, He appeared to some of His disciples who were on a journey to Emmaus, chatted with them, sat with them to eat, took bread and broke it and He gave it to them and then “He vanished out of their sight.”

									</p>
									<p>
										The Omnipresent nature of our Lord Jesus Christ is of great benefit to us. It answers to His name Emmanuel which means “God with us.” Imagine how we call on His name round the clock around the world and He is present everywhere to answer to our cries and give answers to our prayers! What a joy that He is with us in all of our troubles, and in the hottest of our battles, He abides with us. He followed the three Hebrew boys into the fiery furnace. Of course the reality of His presence also helps us to remain holy and abide in the fear of God. David told God that he could not hide from His presence. That fact helped Joseph in his journey. He refrained from committing sin with the wife of Potiphar because He knew that God is omnipresent. He must have told the woman who wanted to force him into a sinful act, that, although no other human person was around, he (Joseph) was a proof of God’s presence in that room. We are the evidence of God’s presence wherever we go and that mentality will help us to behave well at all times.</b>  
									</p>
									<p>
										The omnipresence of God also means that we cannot be stranded in our life’s journey. God’s help will locate us anywhere and He can use anyone and anything to accomplish our victory and meet our needs wherever we may be. Can you imagine that Samson used the jaw bone of a dead ass to kill one thousand Philistines? That is what happens when you are a carrier of His presence. Rejoice in the Lord.
