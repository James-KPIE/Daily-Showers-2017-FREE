									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Matt. 14:14-21 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Mk. 1:41</strong> <br />                         
And Jesus, moved 
with compassion, 
put forth his hand, 
and touched him, 
and saith unto 
him, I will; be 
thou clean.</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">
									<p>
										Compassion is at the root of grace. God extends His grace that saves us because of His mercy. Every sinner deserves the consequences of his or her sin. In all cases we have been made aware of the inevitable punishment that awaits all transgressors of the written laws of God.  Romans 6:23 says: <blockquote>“the wages of sin is death”</blockquote> – spiritual death and any possible death of whatever is good and is dependent on God to thrive. The death which sin brings could show up in sickness, losses, fruitless efforts, shame, ridicule, reproach and social degradation. This is necessarily so because sin causes a disconnect between the sinner and the holy and righteous God.

									</p>
									<p>
										Inspite of man’s full awareness of the laws of God and the judgment that follows their violation, God remains gracious enough to make provision for forgiveness through His compassion because His love is redemptive. If God was like men, many of us would have roasted in hell before we met Jesus. The compassion of God makes Him to see every sinner as a potential saint and so Jesus beckons to sinners everyday to come to Him so He would save them. Through the compassionate heart of Jesus, His mercy discountenances the weight of any man’s sins. There is no kind of sin which this compassionate Lord has not forgiven. His blood has cleansed the foulest sinner. <b>His grace covers our errors and colours our efforts.</b>  
									</p>
									<p>
										Through the compassion of Jesus, the Old Testament of law was made to give way to the New Testament of grace. Where the people under the law laboured to earn their own righteousness <b>by works,</b> we receive the righteousness of Christ by faith. They were <b>achievers,</b> we are <b>receivers.</b> Glory be to the compassionate Jesus. <b>The law condemned the best of men, grace saved the worst of us.</b> All this because of the compassionate heart of Jesus. He died that we may live and He because poor so we may be rich
									</p>
									<p>
										Every time Jesus had compassion towards any person, such a person would receive a miracle, not because he or she is good but because mercy flows from the redemptive love of Jesus. If you turn to Him today, you will enjoy His compassion.   Rejoice in the Lord.
