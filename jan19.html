							<h1>PROPITIATION FOR OUR SIN</h1>

							<!-- Text -->
								<section>
									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Thu. Jan. 19, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style=color:red>Daily Reading: 1 John 4:19-26 </h3>
									<pre><code><b style=color:red>M.V: 1 John 2:2</b> <br />                         
And He is the
propitiation for our
sins: and not for ours
only, but also for
the sins of the
whole world.</code></pre> 

<div align="justify">

									<p>
Our Lord Jesus Christ came to this world to reconcile the sinful man to the Holy God. Our Lord Jesus Christ would only accomplish that task by bearing the guilt of our sin and offering Himself as a sacrifice for our sin. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins. He took up the assignment which the angels were not worthy to undertake. In the first place, angels were not to inhabit
human bodies. They are ministering spirits and to dwell in a human body will be illegal for an angel. Secondly, from the downfall of Lucifer, who was the head of the worshipping angels in heaven, angels could commit sin against God as Lucifer did. Lucifer exalted himself against the throne of God and wanted to usurp the sovereignty and supremacy of the Most High (Read Isaiah 14:12-16).
									</p>
									<p>
Jesus Christ was holy and sinless in nature. The capacity to sin is not in our holy God. Nothing unrighteous can be found in Him. No one who is tainted with sin can stand before the righteous God. The wrath of God must be expended for the sin of man. Our Lord Jesus came as the propitiation for our sin and He became sin for us so He would bear the punishment for our sin. The Father had to turn away from Him, momentarily when He became sin in order to receive the punishment for our sin. In response to the agony of being forsaken by His Father, Jesus Christ cried in anguish: <blockquote>“My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken Me?”</blockquote>. (Mark 15:34). Agony on the cross. Today, we are saved as we put our faith in the finished work of Christ on the cross.									</p>
									<p>
Salvation is free but it is not cheap. Many brethren cannot comprehend the simplicity of salvation. It is simple because someone (Jesus Christ) became the propitiation –our replacement in the guilt and punishment for sin. That is why you are not required to do any act, other than to believe, in order to be saved. It is not about what you can do. Our sin must turn us to Jesus the Saviour and by faith, we should appropriate the benefit of grace which flows from the cross. Jesus paid the price. Rejoice in the Lord.									</p>
