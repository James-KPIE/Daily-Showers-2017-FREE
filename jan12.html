							<h1>KING OF KINGS</h1>

									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Isaiah 9:6-7 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M:V Rev. 17:14</strong> <br />                         
These shall make war 
with the Lamb, and 
the Lamb shall overcome 
them: for he is Lord 
of lords, and King of 
kings: and they that are 
with him are called, and 
chosen, and faithful.</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">
									<p>
										It takes a king to have a kingdom. Jesus is our king. His
Father named Him and made Him to preside over His kingdom. Our memory verse confirms His supremacy and sovereignty. Jesus is Lord of lords and King of kings. Everyone He has redeemed by His blood is a king whom He has given dominion and authority according to Revelation 1:6 and 5:10. We are
redeemed to exercise kingship and dominion on the earth. This is not theory. If we put our faith in the word of God and accept scriptural responsibility, we can rule in practical terms. In other words, in that environment wherein you dwell, you can resist the powers of darkness and turn the counsel of the enemies to nothing. You can exercise your supernatural mandate to resist darkness and cause the light of the gospel to shine through holy living and evangelism. We are not saved to fold our hands and watch the enemy run riot around our vicinity.

									</p>
									<p>
										Jesus Christ is our King and Captain. He rules and reigns over all the kingdoms. Every power is subject to His own power. He has absolute authority over all. Psalm 115:3 says that He is in the heavens and has done what He pleases. When we fight battles we should not forget that He is our Captain. He does not stand behind us in our battles, when He is involved, He stays at the front. It was His unseen hands “at the front” of David that guided the stone from David’s sling to locate the head of Goliath which He had kept in a position that the stone could not miss. Jesus always causes us to triumph in our battles. 
									</p>
									<p>
										It must be emphasized that Jesus Christ is not the King of kings to those who do not acknowledge Him as they rule in cities and towns, especially pagan kings and idolaters. The term kings refer to the redeemed souls, although all rulers who are not saved are subject to His power. Our Lord Jesus recognizes those kings and no one rules without His permission. He is the King over earthly kings and rulers who acknowledge Him as their Saviour. It is a thing of rejoicing today that many traditional rulers all over Africa have surrendered their lives to Christ. The president of Uganda, at a public ceremony, led his nation to a national repentance and a national commitment to serve Jesus Christ as their King of kings and Lord of lords. Rejoice in the Lord.
