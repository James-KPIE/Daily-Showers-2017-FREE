									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Isaiah 53:1-5 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Exo. 15:26</strong> <br />                         
And said, If thou
wilt diligently 
hearken to the voice
of the LORD thy God, 
and wilt do that which 
is right in his sight, 
and wilt give ear to 
his commandments, and 
keep all his statutes, I 
will put none of these 
diseases upon thee, 
which I have brought 
upon the Egyptians: 
for I am the LORD that 
healeth thee.</code></pre>

										It is exciting to know that the Lord has not abandoned our health to the various attacks that we are naturally exposed to in our environments. Many of us have wondered how we survived at infancy when locally made medicines were administered to cure our diseases, without being scientifically tested. Dosages of such drugs were not measured. We drank water from streams around the villages and slept for many years in rooms without nets to prevent mosquito bites. God must have immuned us against the deadly malaria parasites. The method of feeding babies who are made to lie on the laps of their mothers could
choke any little child. Yet, we survived. God had been
interested in our health before we grew up to know modern medicare. We owe our survival to Him.

									</p>
									<p>
										Jesus Christ did the work for our health and healing simultaneously on the cross. It amazes me that all we require to appropriate the blessings of health and healing that flow from Calvary is faith. Jesus Christ told several people whom He healed that it was unto them according to their faith. Friends, your healing is dependent on exercising your faith. Read through Matthew chapter 9 and see how Jesus Christ responded to people’s faith and healed them. The key that opens the door of healing is faith, simple faith.  
									</p>
									<p>
										Faith for healing is not a cheap commodity. The faith which draws the virtue of healing from Christ is faith that is built through our connection with Christ. That is why we must ensure our belonging to Christ before assuming our believing. Belonging is superior to believing. Faith is not exercised just by confession. There must be a conviction. That is, we must be fully persuaded. That is a situation when our belief admits no doubt and it is absolutely unshaken. Any iota of doubt has the capacity to neutralize our faith and render it impotent.
									</p>
									<p>
										Jesus Christ has perfected the work for our healing but we must cooperate with Him through faith. We must also be wise to take care of our body which is God’s temple through proper dieting, exercising and hygienic living. Total health is your portion in Christ. Rejoice in the Lord.
