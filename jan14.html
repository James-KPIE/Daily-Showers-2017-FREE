							<h1>MIRACLE</h1>

							<!-- Text -->
								<section>
									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Sat. Jan. 14, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Isaiah 9:6-7 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M:V. Dan. 6:27</strong> <br />                         
He delivereth and
rescueth, and he
worketh signs and
wonders in heaven
and in earth, who
hath delivered
Daniel from the
power of the lions.</code></pre> 

<div align="justify">

									<p>
										Our Lord Jesus Christ is not only the Miracle-Worker but He Himself is the Miracle. His coming to this world was a miracle – a miracle which occurred once and has never occurred again. Glory be to the Almighty God. The conception of
our Lord Jesus Christ was a miracle. The angel who broke the
news to Mary had to take time to explain to Mary how she would conceive without meeting a man. It came to pass just as God had said.

									</p>
									<p>
										During the life of Jesus Christ, His ministry witnessed so many miracles. There were healing miracles as well as miracles of multiplication. Whatever Jesus Christ touched was multiplied. Everything bowed to Him as a miracle and wonder to those who were around Him. The wind bowed to Him, the water became a stone under His feet. Death surrendered its victims to Jesus. It is amazing that Jesus Christ never addressed death anytime He raised someone who had died. He would just call forth the dead person and death would have no choice but to surrender the victim with full compliance. Nothing ever said no to our miracle-working Jesus.  
									</p>
									<p>
										When Jesus Christ finished His earthly assignment on the cross, He died. A theologian once said it was Jesus that died but Christ raised Jesus from the dead. Christ which means ‘the Anointed One’ cannot bow to death. The mortality of Jesus surrendered to death for a temporary purpose but His immortality raised Him up. He left the tomb in a garment of glory not made by the hand of man because the linen with which His body was wrapped was left inside the tomb, yet He did not go out naked! What a miracle working Saviour Jesus is.
									</p>
									<p>
										When you are born again, you are connected to The Miracle Worker. The greatest obstacles to miracles are sin, unbelief, doubt and disobedience. Many times, we find it difficult to believe the promises God has made. Sometimes, we engage in thinking out how God would do what He had said He would do. Our posture should always be like that of the lad who surrendered his lunch to Jesus in John chapter 6 and turned away. It was left for Jesus to do what He could. When you take your rest by faith, Jesus will do the rest. You are a candidate for a miracle. Rejoice in the Lord.
