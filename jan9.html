									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Heb. 1:1-9 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Heb. 1:3</strong> <br />                         
Who being the brightness
of his glory, and the
express image of his
person, and upholding all
things by the word of his
power, when he had by
himself purged our sins,
sat down on the right
hand of the Majesty on
high;</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">
									<p>
										Jesus Christ is the express image of God. He came in the form of man but with the nature of God, absolutely righteous and without blemish. He took time whenever He preached to tell His audience that He was sent by the Father and that the easiest way to believe in the God whom they had not seen, was to believe in Him. The supernatural works which He did attest to His divinity.

									</p>
									<p>
										Whatever Jesus did in the scriptures represented the will of the Father because He was in harmony with God the Father and God the Holy Spirit in all His doings. In John 8:29, He bore the testimony of being in one accord with His Father. In John 10:30 He declared: “I and my Father are one.” He told the crowd that He only did what His Father approved to be done. We have so much to learn from the representation of Jesus Christ on earth.  
									</p>
									<p>
										Jesus Christ bore the holy image of God. He declared that the prince of this world came to Him but could not find anything that he could accuse Him of. Although He carried the human body and dwelt in the flesh, the scripture says He was tempted in all areas, yet, He did not yield to the temptations. He was tested in the areas in which Adam was tested – lust of the eyes, pride of life and fleshly satisfaction. The devil lost the game in all three counts. After the temptation, angels came to minister to Him. At the height of provocation and battering during which time He sustained bodily injuries on the cross, Jesus Christ was calm because He focused on the purpose for which He came and on the crown that was only obtainable after enduring the cross. Jesus Christ did not curse or threaten His accusers and persecutors.
									</p>
									<p>
										We can learn all life’s lessons from Jesus Christ and do as He did so we can please the Father. We learn patience, endurance, focus, discipline, resolve, self control, self-denial, purity and many more virtues from our Lord Jesus Christ. Above all, Jesus Christ is the greatest example of love. He died for our sins because He loves us. His love is the express image of His Father. Let us love like Jesus. Rejoice in the Lord.
