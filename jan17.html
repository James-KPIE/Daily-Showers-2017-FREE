									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: John 1:43-52 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M:V John 1:47</strong> <br />                         
Jesus saw Nathanael 
coming to him, and 
saith of him, Behold 
an Israelite indeed, 
in whom is no guile!</code></pre> 

<div align="justify">

									<p>
										Our Lord Jesus Christ is all-knowing. I am sure Nathaniel would have wondered at the comment which our Lord Jesus Christ made at their very first meeting. Jesus Christ never
met him previously, yet He knew his make-up. At times, the
Holy Spirit ‘lends’ us a little jot of the omnipresent nature of God as we operate in the gift of the Holy Spirit called <b>word of knowledge</b>. This gift of the Holy Spirit has been described as follows: <blockquote>“The word of knowledge is simply the Holy Spirit transmitting His specific knowledge to you on something that you would have no ability or means to be able to know about with your own limited intelligence and knowledge level.</blockquote>

									</p>
									<p>
										God knows all things. He knows even the thoughts in our hearts which we are yet to bring into manifestation. Jesus Christ knew that Peter would deny Him three times and He told Peter expressly but Peter was naïve. He should have taken caution. The way he argued with his Master, as if he was absolutely in charge of everything he did makes one to see another trick which the fallen nature (the flesh) or carnality can play on us. We beat our chest and declare: ‘that can never happen to me.’ We boast of our age in Christ and our level of interaction with Him and the abundance of our revelations of God and pontificate about our deep knowledge in the things that are spiritual. We easily forget that we are limited in all respects. We are limited in knowledge and ability. We are limited geographically and materially. The sooner we realize our limitations, the more we are able to apply our hearts to wisdom. Someone rightly said that <blockquote>‘a man that knows not and knows not that he knows not is a fool, run from him.’</blockquote> Our boast should be in Christ, not in what we know.  
									</p>
									<p>
										Our limited knowledge is a great advantage to us, spiritually. It helps us to depend absolutely on God and to trust God for His intervention, guidance and help at all times. Those who think they have all the answers won’t learn from other people neither would they depend on God for help when they are in confusion. Knowing that we do not have all the answers because we don’t know it all, causes us to seek to learn. Learners are wise people because they will end up receiving vital knowledge and will become better. Only God is omniscient. Turn to Him. Rejoice in the Lord.
