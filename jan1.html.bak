							<h1>JESUS ONLY</h1>

									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Sun. Jan. 1, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Col. 1:12-20 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: Col. 1:17</strong> <br />                         
And he is before all 
things, and by him all 
things consist.</code></pre>

										It is all about Jesus.  As we welcome one another into this New Year, Jesus is our message and His name shall be our theme for this month. I am tempted to take just one stanza and the chorus from that powerful hymn titled “Jesus only is our message,” composed by Albert B. Simpson (1843-1919) to begin our meditation: 
									</p>
									
									<blockquote>
										<p>Jesus only is our message, <br />
Jesus all our theme shall be <br />
We will lift up Jesus ever<br />
Jesus only will we see</p> 

<p>Jesus only, Jesus ever<br />
Jesus all in all we sing <br />
Saviour, Sanctifier and Healer  <br /> 
Glorious Lord and coming King.</p>

									</blockquote>
									
									<p>
										The other parts of this great hymn refer also to Jesus as our power. He is our hope for eternity. He is our satisfaction and fulfillment. He is the zenith of our joy. Jesus Christ is our strength and sustainer. The greatest thing that can ever happen to man is to be reconciled to God-his Maker from whom he has been estranged because of the sin of Adam. We were all sinners in Adam when they sinned against God in the Garden of Eden. God never created any other person as He created Adam but He put us all in him as seed. Therefore, when he sinned, our nature was tainted with sin because we were all inside Adam. Our Lord Jesus Christ came, not by the seed of man so He would not be corrupted, and He bore the punishment for our sin and the wrath of God for our sin was exhausted on Him to perfect our justification. Since He did that on the cross, everyone that believes in Him and appropriates the benefits of the grace which His cross provided is forgiven and justified and has eternal life. Only Jesus did that for the world. 
									</p>
									
									<p>
										As we explore His names this month, may we encounter Jesus as a revelation both in the Old and New Testaments. Rejoice in the Lord.
