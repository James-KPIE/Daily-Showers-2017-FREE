							<h1>OUR ADVOCATE</h1>

									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Mon. Jan. 2, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: I John 2:1-6 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M.V: 1 John 1:2</strong> <br />                         
(For the life was 
manifested, and we have 
seen it, and bear witness, 
and shew unto you that 
eternal life, which 
was with the Father, 
and was 
manifested unto us;).</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">
									<p>
										An advocate is a person who supports or speaks in favour of another person. In legal parlance, an advocate is the person who defends or pleads one’s case in the court of law. I have had a little experience in that field having been an attorney for thirty-one years.
									</p>
									<p>
										An advocate is sometimes the last hope of a person who is involved in a serious case. Lawyers who are engaged as advocates in criminal cases are often respected within and outside the ‘bar’ if they are able to get their clients acquitted in capital offences such as murder or manslaughter. The punishment for such offences could range from life jail to death by hanging. However, that kind of punishment is not comparable to eternal damnation and the pains of hell in unquenchable fire, to which the soul of an unrepentant sinner is doomed for eternity. Jesus Christ has borne the chastisement for our sin (those who have accepted Him as their Lord and Saviour through repentance from sin). He also stands before the Father to defend us when the adversary brings accusation against us. He pleads His righteousness on our behalf before the Father. It is by the merit of the righteousness of Jesus Christ that the Father can behold us. We have no personal righteousness which we can plead before God. (Philippians 3:9)
									</p>
									<p>
										Only those who abide in Jesus Christ after they are saved enjoy the wonderful benefit of having Jesus Christ as their Advocate. Apart from His advocacy for us, we also have the power of attorney to use His name as we pray (John 14:14). We can also plead His blood to overcome principalities and powers in spiritual conflicts (Rev. 12:11). Whilst we are still on this side of eternity, we can renew our spiritual lives and be quickened as we eat of His flesh and drink of His blood through the Holy Communion that we serve. The meal transmits His life into us (John 6:53). No one can plead your case before the Father as Jesus will do.   
									</p>
									<p>
										You cannot afford to stay outside Christ in this New Year. The benefit of the advocacy of Jesus is only for those who have accepted Him as their Lord and Saviour. You can join them today. Rejoice in the Lord.
