									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Phil. 2:5-11 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M:V Phil. 2:9</strong> <br />                         

Wherefore God also
hath highly exalted
him, and given him a
name which is above
every name:</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">
									<p>
Zenith means the highest, the peak. Jesus Christ is above all and His name is above every other name. Therefore, if you are sick with any disease that has a name, you already have an upper hand as a redeemed soul because whatever the
name of the ailment may be, it is under the name of Jesus. God
created everything in hierarchical order so that the higher power can bear positive influence on those that are below in rank, to maintain order although the corruption in the nature of man has made negative in-roads into that order and men have used the advantage of their higher position to oppress those that are
placed under them. That is an abuse of authority.
									</p>
									<p>
Ecclesiastes 5:8 confirms that there are degrees or layers of authority. It reads <blockquote>“If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and righteousness, do not be amazed at the matter, for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them.”</blockquote> Jesus Christ did not abuse the exalted position which He occupied by the prerogative of the Father. He spoke on the Father’s behalf and confirmed that He did only those things that His Father approved of. He came to project the Father and He never gave glory to Himself. In Hebrews 5:8, the scripture says that he learnt obedience. He did so because He was a commander from the beginning. He condescended to the level of man by coming in the form of man and He was in all things submissive like a slave. Our Lord Jesus teaches us that we can occupy a high office without getting carried away by the power and the influence of that office. <b>His exaltation shows us that the way up is to go down.</b> In John 3:30 we read: “He must increase, but I must decrease.” Jesus Christ was exalted through His humility and submission.									
									
									</p>
									<p>
It has been said that humility is power under control. If we desire to be promoted, it is not a sin. The motive behind the desire is the issue. Our lifting should be an avenue to be of greater value to the kingdom and of greater use to mankind. We can enjoy divine lifting but it must not be abused. Rejoice in the Lord.
