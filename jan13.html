									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: John 4:3-14 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M:V John 4:14</strong> <br />                         
But whosoever drinketh of
the water that I shall give
him shall never thirst; but
the water that I shall give
him shall be in him a well of
water springing up
into everlasting life.</code></pre> 


<div align="justify">
									<p>
										Water is a life supporter. In the natural, man can survive on water alone without food for many days. At the age of 74, with the toll of age on his body, Mahatma Gandhi, the famous non-violent campaigner for India’s Independence, survived 21 days of total starvation while only allowing himself sips of
water. I know pastors who have gone up to forty days fasting on water alone. In the spiritual context, water stands for life and living water is an expression which describes full spiritual life. That is a life full of the presence and influence of God with no room for the flesh. That should be the heart desire of every believer.

									</p>
									<p>
										The Christian life’s joy is at the peak when we are empty of the flesh and full of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit is associated with water in different forms. In Ezekiel 34:25, He is the ‘showers of blessing.’ When the Bible speaks of the dew from the mountains, it has the same connotation. In John 7:38 Jesus Christ our Lord said that out of those who believe on Him shall flow rivers of living water. In Ephesians 5:26 this water is referred to as the cleansing and sanctifying water that washes us. In this last reference, water stands for the word of God that cleanses and purifies. Without the word of God we cannot be purified. Our minds can only be renewed by the word of God (Romans 12:1-2).  
									</p>
									<p>
										Is it not interesting that water refers to the Holy Spirit and to the word of God? The word of God is inspired by the Holy Spirit. When the body of our Lord Jesus was pierced with the spear by those who crucified Him, blood and water gushed out. Blood repurchased us from the captivity into which Adam sold our souls through sin and water continues to cleanse us to make us presentable to our Husband (Jesus Christ) whose bride we are. That is how every born again son and daughter is born of the blood and of water.
									</p>
									<p>
										Jesus Christ died to give us life. He gives life to us in full measure. We can drink from His water of life every morning as we connect to Him through worship at the altar. He is the Living water that never runs dry. He is inexhaustible. Rejoice in the Lord.
									</p>
