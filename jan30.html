									<h3>Written by: Ayomide Abraham</h3>							<h4 align="right">Mon. Jan. 30, 2017</h4>
									
									<h3 style="color:red">Daily Reading: Luke 19:29-38 </h3>
									<pre><code><strong style="color:red">M:V Luke 19:31</strong> <br />                         

And if any man ask you,
Why do ye loose him?
thus shall ye say unto
him, Because the Lord
hath need of him.</code></pre> 

<div align="justify">
									<p>
Jesus Christ is Lord over all. A ‘lord’ is one who is in charge. A lord bears influence and exercises the power of control. Jesus Christ our Lord is the Lord of lords and King of kings. All kings bow down before Him to worship Him and
proclaim “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty.” I remember a short worship song that goes this way: <b>Heaven and earth adore Him, angels bow before Him, You are beautiful, You are beautiful.</b> Jesus Christ the Lord is beautiful for all situations according to Psalm 48:1-2. When we acknowledge His lordship, He makes our ugly situations beautiful.
									</p>
									<p>
Adonai is from the root word ‘adon’ in Hebrew which means to ‘own.’ The Creator of heaven and earth is the owner of all things upon and underneath the earth. In Greek, the word ‘lord’ is kurious that is the possessor and disposer of a thing. Only the owner or possessor of a thing can dispose of it legally; if any other person does, it will amount to trespass or theft or illegal conversion. In the story of the colt that was brought for our Lord Jesus Christ to ride upon into Jerusalem, Jesus Christ exercised His lordship over the colt. His ownership is superior to the ownership of the one who tied the colt down in his premises! In truth He owns the so-called owner of the colt.									
									
									</p>
									<p>
People who struggle with God and are not able to release the substance in their hands for the kingdom use need more understanding. Christians who withhold their tithe need more knowledge of the workings of the kingdom to which they lay claim to belong. God owns everything because He created them all we shall see this in greater detail tomorrow. At times, in order for heaven to bless you, grace may move you to surrender the little in your possession so that the possessor of heaven and earth may release abundance unto you. This is what I call KINGDOM COVENANT REWARD SYSTEM. When grace helps you to trigger it and you do, all the witches and wizards in the whole world cannot stop your harvest of increase. That is the believers heritage in redemption.									
									
									</p>
									<p>
The wise believer will not struggle with his Maker. Adonai is also Jehovah Jireh-the Jehovah ‘overdo’ in the order of Ephesians 3:20. Surrender all to Adonai and watch Him bless you abundantly. Rejoice in the Lord.
